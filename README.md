# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I was left with an application with an incomplete test suite. 

According to my tutors at [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com), I have to implement my new knowledge in Test Driven Develpment(TDD) to code the complete application.

This project is hosted at [Feed Reader Testing](https://gerrarde.github.io/feedReaderTesting)

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## Test Tool

Jasmine
